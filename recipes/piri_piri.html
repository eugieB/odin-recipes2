    <p>Peri peri sauce is -a blend of chilies, fresh garlic, jalapeno pepper, red pepper, basil, onions oregano, smoked paprika, salt, lemon and olive oil. It is sour, a little sweet and slightly salty- making it a really complex and versatile sauce that you can use on almost anything. Chicken should be a good starting point (legs, thighs, breast) they would do just fine.</p>
