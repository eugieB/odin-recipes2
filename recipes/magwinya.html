    <h2>Ingridient</h2>
    <ul>
        
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons instant yeast</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil (plus more for frying)</li>
        <li> 2 cups warm water</li>
        
        

    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the dry ingredients: flour, sugar, yeast, and salt. Mix well.</li>

        <li>Add the water and 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil and mix into a soft dough.</li> 
            
        <li>Cover the mixture with a tea towel and allow to rise for about one hour. The dough should roughly double in size.</li>   
            
        <li>Mix further and let the dough rest for 10 minutes.</li>   
            
        <li>Heat a large pot of vegetable oil over a medium flame for deep frying. Test the temperature of the oil by dropping a little batter in. If it sizzles, you’re ready to start frying.</li>    
            
        <li>With a tablespoon, add dollops of dough into the oil, using a second spoon to help push the dough down if necessary. Make sure you turn them frequently until golden brown.</li> 
            
        <li>Drain over paper towels and serve whilst they are warm.</li>
